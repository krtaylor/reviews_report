What is it?
===========
Just a simple tool I wrote as an exercise to gather review stats
from the Stackalytics API, filtering on company and user.

How do you use it?
==================
First, edit the code to change the company to the one you are interested in.
Next, edit the launchpad users to be valid users for your company.

run with ./reviews.py
supply the release that you would like to gather stats on.
